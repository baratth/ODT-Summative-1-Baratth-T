# ODT-Summative-1-Baratth-T
At BITS Design School Mumbai, we were given an assignment to create an interactive game in 4 hours as part of our Open Design and Technology Module. We combined our learnings from the past 7 weeks to create an F1-inspired, reflex and observation-based racing game called Drag Race. This is a project made by Baratth T and Bhumika Vaidya.
